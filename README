----GESTURE LOCK----

A lock that is unlocked not by a key, or a number wheel, or a fingerprint, but by displaying the right hand gesture or gestures in front of the lock.
A camera embedded in the device will scan for the right gesture.
The code is in python and will most likely run on openCV, or mediapipe, or both to trace the joints in the hand.
tensorflow machine learning will be used to estimate which hand gesture is being displayed based on the openCV/mediapipe output.
